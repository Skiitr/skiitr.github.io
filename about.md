Hi, my name is Dan Gallagher and I am a designer. I’ve held many titles over the course of my career, but overall what I do is - I design stuff. What exactly? The bulk of my experience has been in hardware design, specifically in printed circuit board design. I have had the good fortune to work at many companies that have allowed me hands-on experience with just about all there is to see in electronics design and manufacturing. This exposure has given me a very broad view of hardware engineering while still being responsible for the individual details that come with design work.

Over the years, sparks of curiosity have struck leading me down many different paths of self-study. Six months here, two years there; I’ve gained a lot of pertinent (technological) information during these spurts. One of the most significant of these lead me down the path of web design and development, and this is where I have chosen to expand my career into Front-End Web Development.

Using the continued knowledge that I acquire across many different technology disciplines, I have found great success in my day-to-day career. I’m hoping for this site to be the platform in which I can communicate, professionally and otherwise, all that I have to offer.

Please feel free to contact me regarding anything you would like to discuss. I'm happy to answer any and all questions you might have about my experience as well as any questions you might have about the industries in which I've worked and technologies with which I’m familiar. See below for all methods in which to get in touch with me. The easiest and most effective way to get in touch with me is through email. 

Enjoy!
