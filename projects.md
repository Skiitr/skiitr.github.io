A small sample of projects I've been involved with over the years...

## Printed Circuit Board Layout 
(2001 - Present >> 14 years)

### 6x 30W Transmit Power Amplifiers (30MHz-6GHz) 
This project included a tough requirement in that six modules had to be created each of a different frequency to cover the 30MHz to 6GHz band. Each amplifier had to be in the same package and be interchangeable. The success of the board layouts in the project came from creating a common platform in which we could supply all the control and power rails into 6 custom transmit amplifiers.

### Certified Avionics GPS / Nav / Com Systems
Developed and maintained all 14 board designs for an avionics GPS/NAV/COM systems. The system includes front and backplane boards, display and button boards, 16W VHF radio boards as well as I/O and computational boards. Board technologies involved include high-speed digital, RF (VHF band), differential pairs, up to 17 layer boards, blind and epoxy filled cap plated vias. Designs required jigsaw fitting of PCBs into one another due to limited space. The project was successful though very close integration of the mechanical and electrical teams due to aggressive packaging.

### Data Processor for Flying Projectile Sensor
The requirements for this board design were a very small tight package that could fit in a flying sensor that contained extremely sensitive RF circuitry as well as a vast number of high-speed digital circuitry for data processing. Board contained two 100+ pin quad flat pack chips followed by an array of four 300+ pin BGAs. The technology of the board was in the 4mil trace and 4mil space range and contained 12 layers of which two were power planes, four ground planes and 6 were routing layers. The board was done without isolating ground planes and was successful at keeping all high-speed switching noise from the large amount of RF circuitry and vice versa. Each BGA had over 200 data connections and the board was hand routed for optimal efficiency of particular critical data lines. Board design functioned to specification on the first spin of the design.

## Mechanical Engineering
(2007 - Present >> 8 years)

### Low Loss Space Qualified Pre-filtered GPS LNA
This project was challenging due to the space qualification of the product. Everything on the design had to be designed to the highest standards. With soldered in tunable resonators for the cavity filter, custom transition tough a discrete low pass filter and finally going through a very low loss LNA, this project presented a muti-dimensional mechanical challenge. The final challenge of this project was that all qualification testing was required on every unit produced and the design passed all testing requirements.

### 30-512 MHz VHF / UHF 20W TX/RX Amplifier w/ Switched Filter Bank
Project difficulties presented here was a tight mechanical outline with many fixed ports for both the VHF in and out, UHF in and out, and GPS receive channel. The approach taken here was a 4 mezzanine layered structure with different circuits top and bottom sides of each layer. The design was built as individual levels and assembled together with flex circuit cables and flexible RF connections. A low-frequency discrete switched filter bank became the largest challenge to both fit in the design as well as connect the receive and transmit paths of the amplifiers. Placing one power amplifier on top of another presented a significant thermal challenge that was overcome through finite element analysis and experimentation. The design of the project was finished and the contract never went into production due to funding falling through for the end customer. 

### Avionics Front Panel Integration
Project involved working with two separate partner companies to customize two pieces of avionics equipment, an audio panel and transponder to match the company standards. During this process, it was required to create and design guide for a uniform style throughout each of five products currently under development as well as coordinate these developments to each of the partner companies we were working with. I was the principle engineer of these two products internally and worked closely with partner companies to ensure all specification were met to keep a standard look and feel to the products. The mechanical design required designing a usable customer interface with both backlit buttons and LCD display. These products were successfully developed internally and produced by our partner companies.

### RF Test Fixture Design (10MHz-21GHz)
Frequently I have been asked to design test verification fixtures for RF products. These fixtures require very precision design and any added performance degradation in signal strength or quality would affect product testing. I was responsible for mechanical design, fabrication, and assembly of these test fixtures. I worked closely with Electrical engineering to understand all electrical specification required. These fixtures required a level of human interaction design as well because most of these required someone to manual process 10-100 units though the fixtures regularly. Types of product that required fixturing were mixers, amplifiers, VCOs, and DROs. Many fixtures would take a design or two to achieve full specification compliance but in the end the designs would be both cable of testing the product and be easy to use.

### Transmit Amplifiers for IED Jamming System (10MHz-6GHz) 
The project was to design six mechanically identical 30W transmit amplifier modules each with a unique frequency band to cover overall the whole 10MHz to 6GHz spectrum. I was the principle mechanical engineering on this project and was responsible for all the packaging and planning of the module configuration. I worked closely with electrical engineers and board layout designers to create a uniform layout throughout each module. Designing high and low-frequency amplifiers in identical packaging was a large challenge. Also, a sealing requirement for sand and dust was required which was achieved through a mezzanine system with laser cut conductive silicone gaskets. Integration of the heatsink for each amplifier also was challenging as the package was very aggressively sized. This product met all design requirements and was successfully delivered to the customer.

## Web Development
(2014 - Present >> 1 year)

### [Simplicity Sprouts](http://simplicitysprouts.com)
This site is a Wordpress blog I developed and maintain for my wife. This was the first full site I've helped create. This was a steep learning curb to learn Wordpress development and create a custom theme. The successful rollout of the site was done in May 2015.

### [Calculist](http://slylion.com/calculist)
A simple web application whose purpose is to be both a simple calculator and a list program to store calculations. I found myself always needing a calculation I made 3 or 4 steps previous and would either have to write the info down as I went or re-calculate values. This application was to service that need.

### [Personal Portfolio Page](http://dangallagher.xyz)
Designed and Developed the site this write up is on from scratch. I designed the mockup in Keynote. Jekyll was used both as a post processor for Sass and as a static site generator. Using Git for my version control, I was able to push this to Git Pages and deploy modifications easily.

### Printed Circuit Board Standardization
The project started to bring 10 years worth of boards design under the same design and manufacturing standards. Improvements to the internal standards covered, documentation (fabrication, assembly, and bills of materials), data management (assembly data, metadata in schematics), component standardization (part count reduction, bills of material auditing), and design rules for fabrication, test, and manufacturing.
