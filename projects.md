A small sample of projects I've been involed with over the years...

## Printed Circuit Board Layout 
(2001 - Present >> 14 years)

### 6x 30W Transmit Power Amplifiers (30MHz-6GHz) 
This project included a tough requirement in that six modules had to be create each of a diffrent frequency to cover the 30MHz to 6GHz band. Ecah amplifier had to be in the same package and be interchangable. The sucess of the board layouts in the project came from creating a common platform in which we could supply all the control and power rails into 6 custom trnismet amplifiers.

### Certified Avionics GPS / Nav / Com Systems
Developed and maintainted all 14 board designs for a avionics GPS/NAV/COM systems. System includes front and back plane boards, display and button boards, 16W VHF radio boards as well as I/O and computational boards. Board technologies involved include high speed digital, RF (VHF band), differentail pairs, up to 17 layer boards, blind and epoxy filled cap plated vias. Designs required jigsaw fitting of PCBs into one another due to limited space. Project was sucessful though very close integration of the mechanical and electrical teams due to agressive packaging.

## Mechanical Engineering
(2007 - Present >> 8 years)

### Low Loss Space Qualified Pre-filtered GPS LNA
This project was challenging due to the space qualification of the product. Everything on the design had to be designed to the highest standards. With soldered in tunable resonators for the cavity filter, custom transition tough a descrete low pass filter and finally going through a very low loss LNA, this project presented a multi dimentioal mechanical challenge. The final challenge of this project was that all qualification testing was required on every unit produced and the design passed through all testing requirments.

### 30-512 MHz VHF / UHF 20W TX/RX Amplifier w/ Switched Filter Bank
Project difficulties presented here was a tight mechanical outline with many fixed ports for both the VHF in and out, UHF in and out, and GPS recieve chanel. The approach taken here was a 4 mezinene layered structure with difrrent circuits top and bottom sides of each layer. The design was built as individul levels and assembled together with flex ciruit cables and flexable RF connections. A low frequency descrete switched filter bank became the largest challge to both fit in the design as well as connect the the recieve and transmit paths of the amplifiers. Placing one power amplifier on top of another presented a significat thermal challenge that was overcome though finite element analysis and expermentation. The design of the project was finished and the contact never went into production due to funding falling through for the end customer.

## Web Development
(2014 - Present >> 1 year)

### [Simplicity Sprouts](http://simplicitysprouts.com)
This site is a Wordpress blog I developed and maintain for my wife. This was the first full site I've helped create. This was a steep learning curn to learn Wordpress development and create a custom theme. Successful rollout of the site was done in May 2015.

### [Calculist](http://slylion.com/calculist)
A simple web application whos purpose to to be both a simple calculator and a list program to store calculations. I found myself always needing a calculation I made 3 or 4 steps previous and would either have to write the info down as I went or re-calcuate values. This application was to service that need.

### [Personal Portfolio Page](http://dangallagher.xyz)
Designed and Developed the site this write up is on from scratch. I designed the mockup in Keynote. Jekyll was used both as a post processor for Sass and as a static site generator. Using Git for my version control I was able to push this to Git Pages and deploy modifications easily.

## Process Engineering
(2007 - 2012 >> 4 years)

### Printed Circuit Board Standarization
Project stated to bring 10 years worth of boards design under the same design and manufacturing standards. Improvments to the internal standards covered, documention (fabrication, assembly, and bills of materials), data managemnt (assembly data, metadata in schematics), component standardization (part count reduction, bills of material auditing), and design rules for fabrication, test and manufacturing.
