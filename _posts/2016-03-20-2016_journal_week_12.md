My family and I are back to the normal swing of things again this week. I’m happy to be finding the inspiration to take on harder and more challenging projects. I have two new projects I’m looking forward to sinking my teeth into this week.

At work, I finally completed a board layout project I’d been trying to get over some hurdles since the beginning of the year. It has been a huge relief to have this board past the final design review and on ECO for release. I also cleaned up about 6 or 7 other pending issues that were on hold while I was finishing off the last three board layouts. At the end of the week, I finished off almost my entire backlog of work and next week I hope to have everything wrapped up. I have given some thought to tearing down our broken 3D printer and seeing if I can‘t get it back up and running. It might be possible that I can get to that next week.

In my self-study, I pushed through another Treehouse course, MongoDB Basics. With this class completed I have completed the JavaScript Full Stack skill track at Treehouse. That along with the Font End Development track is now two completed. And with that complete, I’m going to take a break from Treehouse in order to put some more time into my own projects.

The first project I’m working on is a revamp of the Calculist application I developed last year. Originally this app was a crude calculator with only a few functions and didn’t look anything like a proper calculator. The listing functions were nice, but a few of the people that tested it thought it would be nice to have access to the list data later or on another device. These are the two goals of the new application I’m developing. I would like to first make this a full-fledged calculator that looks and feels like one you’d pull up in any native operating system. The second goal would be to authenticate users and allow them to keep their data persistent across platforms. So far I’m thinking I’d use Angular and Firebase for this but we will see as the app develops.

The second project I’m working on is creating a dedicated web development portfolio site. I currently have a site that is for both my PCB design work as well as my web development accomplishments. My desire is to break them apart so I can more clearly demonstrate my skills in either without one getting in the way of the other. So far I’ve only worked on a few mockups in Keynote but as I get time hopefully I can decide on a platform I would like to use to help build the site.

I know I’ve said this in past weeks but I’ll reiterate it again. I love learning, I love the struggle of hacking on something until I get it to work, I love the feeling once I finally can finish something and know that I have new skills to work with. But most of all, I love taking those new skills and refining them into the best working model to help make my daily life better. Each week is its own animal and I never know what will spring up next, but I am hopeful I will be able to handle whatever comes my way.
