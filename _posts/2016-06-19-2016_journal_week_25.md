Happy Father’s Day! I’m honored to celebrate today with my kids as well as with my fathers. My dad and step-father have been two of the most inspiring people in my life. My father has taught me the basis from which I attack most problems in life and always taught me the value of hard work and doing your share. My step-father started me down the path of technology which is both my career and passion to this day. To both of them, I want to say thanks for always being there and gifting me such wonderful values.

Finishing now my third week at the new company I’m learning more and more with each passing day. I’m still having a bit of a technical issue getting going with any major work, but hopefully, this will all be resolved by Monday morning.

My big milestone this week comes in the form of attending my first web conference. I was able to attend the Front End Design Conference in St. Petersburg, Florida this past Thursday and Friday. It was an amazing conference and had people like Aaron Draplin, Ethan Marcotte, Samantha Warren, Doug Neiner, and many more. At face value, it was two days of talks, but really it ended up being two days of constant inspiration and moving moments. I have come away from the conference with so many new ideas and inspirations. I’m very grateful I was able to go. Thanks to both my employer for giving me the time and to my family who did without me for a few days so I could attend.

I started a new book on my drives to work this week and I think I made it about 6-8 hours into a 28-hour novel. The book is the first in the Jack Ryan series by Tom Clancy, called Without Remorse. So far I’m enjoying it. I’m not sure I like Tom Clancy more than I do Lee Child but this is hard to say only a quarter of the way into my first book by him. Hopefully, I’ll put a large dent in this book in the upcoming week.

Father’s Day, Front End Design Conference, and my third week at work, I’m exhausted in the best way possible. One goal for next week is to pick out a new web development/design project, something small and finish it inside of the week. Another one is to get back to some form of workout consistency. Any amount of exercise has been so hit or miss lately I need to find a better balance. If I can achieve one or both of these next week I’m sure that will set me up well for the future.
