Date: November 4th, 2015

I'm very excited to launch my portfolio site. I've been working on this for about 4 months on and off and have gone back to the drawing board more than a few times in order to achieve the vision I hoped for.

After various attempts, my final solution came by way of Keynote to mock up the whole idea for the site and to explore how to make the site responsive. This included all the visual elements and the component design of the site.

After Keynote, I was looking for something I could use as a static site generator and found that Jekyll filled this role very nicely. After a quick course on Jekyll and Git, I was up and running in a matter of days. Over the course of a week, I was able to take my site from a mockup to a coded website.

The last piece of the puzzle, and I image this is the hardest for anyone creating a site to show off their hard work, was to fill it with content. My first goal was to get it on paper in a 'minimum viable product' way.

As I move forward I'm looking forward to being able to use Jekyll to build my site locally and easily sync this up and push changes out via Git and Github pages.

We will see how this goes...
