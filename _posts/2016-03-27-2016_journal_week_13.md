Fun is defined as enjoyment, amusement, or lighthearted pleasure. This week has been a reminder of what fun and relaxing work can be like. I was not on Spring Break, but as far as how a normal week can go, this was a very pleasant week. After all the hard work, the studying, and things that need to get done, it’s nice to take a moment and work on some tasks with no pressure and just enjoy what you are doing.

In my PCB / mechanical design work, I closed off 8 different issues I have been working on for the past few weeks. It is a very satisfying feeling to finish off a large list of tasks you once thought impossible to complete. After processing all of the paperwork associated with releasing a few new board designs, a fixture, and some document updates, I was looking for another task to work on.

We once had a nice 3D printer here at Avidyne, but for 2 years it has been considered broken. It’s an industrial grade FDM printer and to replace it would cost us upwards of $50K. I figured this would be a good time to try and bring the printer back to life. I attacked this puzzle using the same process I use for anything I’m not too familiar with. I start tearing it down until I find pieces that I can understand or until I find something obvious that is broken. In this case, I was able to identify two familiar pieces: a small embedded motherboard and a hard drive. After running some tests on the hard drive I concluded it was healthy, so I was on to the motherboard. After inspecting the motherboard I identified VGA, keyboard, and mouse pins I could wire into. Once I was able to wire the video up, it showed us the drive was hung waiting for a partition to clear an error. I was then able to run a check disk on the drive and clear the error outside of the machine.  After almost 2 years of being dead, the printer was back to life. After booting the machine successfully, I then fought the normal printhead issues and after disassembling the head and clearing clogs about 6 times I had the machine in working order again. With nothing to lose in the attempt to fix the machine, I felt great being able to fix the issues and have this machine available for everyone to use again.

In my web development studies, as I mentioned last week I’ve paused my classes to focus on a few projects I want to start making headway on. I was able to style up my Calculist2 application as well as start to add calculator functionality to it using Angular. The data binding in Angular really helps with dynamic DOM manipulation. In addition to this project, it always bugged me how mundane feeling I left the Trello Data Reporter. So I spent a few hours one night and spruced the application view up a bit. Working on these two projects, I’ve really been able to see the effort put into learning each of these technologies paying off.

So I’ve styled up a few web applications, started writing code to control Calculist2, and brought a once-thought-to-be dead 3D printer back to life. Best of all with no real pressure to finish any of these things, it allowed me to take pleasure in the work I was doing and I had a lot of fun this week.
