This past week my family and I went on vacation, therefore I took a vacation from my journal. In the past two weeks, many things have happened. I had my first board design released at work, I took a week-long vacation to visit my brother and his family in Boston, and I had the opportunity to listen to some of the best podcasts I've heard since I started commuting for work. Overall, I've had lots of personal development and some relaxing time with the family.

At work, I feel like I’m hitting my stride. I’m able to accomplish the vast majority of what I feel I should be getting done each day and hopefully in the coming weeks I can make this more like 95-100% of what I hope to be accomplishing. I completed and released my first board design and am most of the way through my second design. I feel like every day I’m either learning something new from someone with more experience or I’m teaching myself a new trick or two. I feel fortunate to be learning as much as I have.

During my commute, I’ve been listening to many different podcasts. The most influential ones at the moment are The Tim Ferriss Show and You Are Not So Smart, both of these aim to teach listeners new ideas, ones which you can either apply to your life or just for general reference. I’ve learned quite a bit about stoicism and fallacies from these podcasts. The lessons on stoicism are very moving to me and feel like they fit my personality style quite a bit and I’ve been trying to apply a lot of what I’ve learned on a daily basis.

This past week my family and I took a trip up to Boston to visit my youngest brother and his family. Since they have moved up north it is harder to see them and they are some of our favorite people to hang out with, so having a whole week with them was a very nice treat. My two nephews are just adorable and hilarious and they get along so well with our kids. It was a wonderful experience. I feel like I've gained about 5 pounds after eating the delicious desserts that my sister-in-law made for us while we were there.

They live outside of Boston on an Air Force base, so one day we took a trip into the city. We saw Faneuil Hall, Beacon Hill, Boston Common, and some of the North End. We enjoyed good food and many historical landmarks. In addition to the journey to the city, we took a hike almost every day to see other historic sites outside of Boston. And as a bonus, my sister and her wife joined us for a day there as well. Overall just a wonderful family vacation.

After a full week at work, and a long vacation we are all happy to be home this weekend. All of us have a bit of decompressing to do. I’m looking forward to getting back to my routine and this time without a break in sight I’m ready to see what 3-4 weeks regular work with commuting feels like. I hope to organize my other routines with a few weeks to test them out properly. If all goes well I’ll be able to test a few new things out in the coming week.
