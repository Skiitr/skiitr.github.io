The week was a very basic week. Not much happened, and after last weekend’s full-featured schedule I am very happy this was the case. I pressed forward with my current projects and at work I was given a big task which I’ve enjoyed sinking my teeth into.

This week I was given the task of tearing down a piece of technology to better understand how it was built and designed. This is always a great opportunity to learn and experience a design through the eyes of another designer and try to understand the hows and whys of their thought process. I’ve been tasked with not only looking at the structure but estimating the cost of the build and mapping out an overall technical diagram of the unit. Exploring technology and digging into design work is my passion and seeing the finished product of another design team is very fascinating.  

In my web development studies, I’m noticing how much I have to learn about software design and attacking big challenges. The calculator I’ve written for Calculist 2 has been a learning lesson at every step and this week was no exception. Creating state diagrams and reviewing my functions to ensure I could cover all of the possible states and inputs was something I have never undertaken at this scale previously. I’m happy to report it seems Calculist 2 is nearing the completion of its first stage. This will allow me to publish the first working version. After nearly 4 weeks of working on this about 5-6 hours a week, I’m very excited about being able to release an initial version of the application. I have been missing my schooling and have been considering going back to Code School or Egghead.io and seeing what I can learn from these but this will have to wait until I can get to a break point in my current project.

In addition to my work on Calculist 2, I have been continuing my reading of You Don’t Know JS.  I have had less time to put into these books than I would have hoped, but next week I intend to put a larger dent in my reading and understanding the content in these books. I’m also considering making Codewars a more regular thing when I’m not actively programming in order to keep my skills fresh. I’d also like to dive deeper into ES6 and Codewars is a good place to get some practice with the latest version of JavaScript.

It’s been a quiet week, but I learned quite a bit between my teardown project at work and my application development at home. Hopefully, I’ll publish the first version of Calculist 2 soon and I’m looking forward to digging into Javascript more in the coming week.
