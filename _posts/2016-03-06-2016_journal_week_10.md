Good weeks and bad weeks, light and heavy, busy and quiet, weeks come in all shapes and sizes and each week seems to be different from the last. This week fell in the heavy and busy categories. I was able to get quite a bit done even though it was so busy. I’m tired and excited as this week comes to a close.

At work this week, I finished one of two new board layouts. I was also able to clear an obstacle on a layout that has been awaiting testing results. I’ll be glad to finish that one next week. In addition to these two things I was also given a list of new board builds we need to update documentation on for in-house builds. Updating one of these board documents allowed me to use the new fabrication notes document I created and this resulted in reducing a drawing with 30+ notes down to 4.

I started my web development studies this week with a course on Gulp from Treehouse. This was very informative and I learned quite a bit. I then spent two days working and re-working my Gulp configuration on my Trello Data Reporter. In the end, I now have a solid set of tasks to build, develop, and deploy this project. I tried to put Browserify into my task runner and this caused quite a bit of grief due to newer versions and not working with vinyl streams or something of that nature. I then took it back out in favor of a simpler way of pulling my JavaScripts files together. I want to get Browserify running but it will be a project for another day.

The Gulp course on Treehouse wasn’t the only tool learning I did this week. I also found the fairly new podcast, Toolsday, and proceeded to binge on five episodes in about 24 hours. This was one of the reasons I went down the Browserify path with my project. I learned about task runners, module loaders, learning tools, style guides, and development environments. I feel like after a year or working on projects I have some opinions on these topics and it is nice to hear a professional's take to compare notes.

This weekend Code School hosted a free weekend where you could login and take any of their courses for free. I wanted to take advantage of this. I’ve tried Code School a little bit in the past but I’ve been meaning to give Code School as much of a trial as I did with Treehouse or with Codecademy and this weekend has helped me do this. I took two classes on Angular.js and very much enjoyed how they were presented. I learned a whole heap of new information, and can’t wait to use it.

On the personal side the week was a little rough. We had a few taxing incidents happen, including an injured dog, parent, and grandparent. Thankfully these were all separate incidents and everyone is on the mend now. My daughter also had a full week with an extra few activities added in so this has kept us extra busy.

Taking a deep breath at the end of this week, I do feel good (and exhausted) about what I’ve accomplished. Maybe this is a note about next week, one hard then one easy? Only time will tell I guess.
