This week was all about the weekend. Once a year the company I work for, Avidyne, sends its employees to a large fly-in air show in Lakeland called Sun ‘n Fun. This is one of two of the largest trade shows the company attends. About half of the major new product announcements happen there. So I used the opportunity to prolong my daughter’s birthday festivities and turn this into a weekend trip.

At work this week, most things were quiet as everyone was either getting ready for Sun ‘n Fun, actually attending the show, or working at our booth. In the hardware engineering department, I spent the week setting up for new tasks that are coming down the road. A few of which are new versions of existing boards we produce now.  Another big task I worked on this week was a component obsolescence issue that came up. One of our products has a display that went end of life and I was asked to find replacement display so we could extend the product's life. The work week, as I noted previously, ended by attending Sun ‘n Fun.

The air show was very exciting. Not only did I get to see the Avidyne booth but I saw how busy the booth was, which is very exciting. I also got a chance to look at our competition and see their new line of products. I went to the airshow with my family and was able to explore all of the aircraft at the show with them. There was everything from small general aviation aircraft to big jumbo jets, and all sorts of warplanes - both old and new. Both my little ones and my wife enjoyed being able to attend this with me this year.

We finished our weekend by staying in Tampa and going to the Lowry Park Zoo. This zoo is fascinating and the array of animals they have is quite impressive. The elephants, rhinos, koala, giraffes, tiger, chimpanzee, komodo dragon, and orangutans were amazing. My wife and I always have a hard time fighting feeling bad for the animals that are in small enclosures against being able to expose our children to new and exciting wildlife. It’s always a hard thing for us to feel good about as parents.

In my web development work this week I have kept chugging on Calculist2. I’ve found it to be quite a challenge having to learn the ins and outs of programming a user-friendly calculator. I feel by the end of this I’ll have really upped my programming game seeing how I’ve come at this from about 5 different ways to get to where I am now. I hope to be wrapping up the first releasable version soon. I was also able to read a few more chapters of You Don’t Know JS and, as most reviews have said about the series, it is really nice how in depth this goes into the Javascript language.

My legs, feet, back, and shoulders hurt from all the walking and carrying of kids this weekend, but we had such a great time it is worth every muscle pain. I can’t wait to move further with Calculist2, and am excited about the upcoming board layouts at work as well. Here is to a productive week ahead.
