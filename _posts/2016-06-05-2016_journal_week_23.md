This was a week of figuring out the new routine around the first week at my new job. It was only a four day week so we will see how next week plays out, but I feel I didn’t quite get the hang of it in that short amount of time. This was also the first week of summer for my family so for us this means my wife has to close out the homeschooling year for my daughter. This will be our final order of business before the summer officially starts.

This was my first week at Orion Technologies. Things went well and I’m slowing getting up to speed with what it is I’ll be doing day to day. You often ask yourself with a new job move if you feel like you made the right decision and every day this week I’ve been faced with the dichotomy of this question. I think the company seems great and I’m excited about the opportunities I feel like I will have there, but the commute is tough. At best, it’s an hour and ten minutes; at worst, an hour and forty-five minutes. The latter is very hard to swallow. Some of this appears to be construction-based so I’m hopeful this will clear up once that is completed.

In my web development studies, I was able to listen to about 4 podcasts and found some very good information in the newer Toolsday episodes I listened to, as well as the episode of the Shop Talk Show on animation. I was also able to fix a bug I found a few weeks ago in AviFish where the XML parsing didn’t like having the ‘&’ symbol in the code. I was able to write a cleaning function that I can plug characters into and it will replace them with the escaped version of the character.

I’m only two weeks away from the Front End Design Conference I’ll be attending in St. Petersburg. This will be my first web conference and I’m very excited about getting to immerse myself in this for two days straight, but still feel like I need to prep more before I get there.

My drive has also afforded me the time to listen to other things. My first desire was to cut through some audiobooks I’ve been meaning to get to, but all of them were on loan at the library so this is on hold until they become available. I was, however, able to check out the Tim Ferriss Show podcast and I can’t recommend this more highly to anyone looking to better themselves and learn the habits of very high performing individuals in this world. The episode with Edward Norton was completely fascinating.

My family has also been feeling the strain of the longer commute and we are still working on a good way to work this out every day. I’m sure with a bit of hard work and preparation we will come to a good balance with it all. But besides that we have been keeping up with our daily workouts for the most part (missing only a day or two in the last few weeks). We are about half way through the darebee.com Foundation workout series. Hopefully, with getting our routine in order we can improve on the few missed days and be back to 100% again.

New challenges, new job, new adventures. Our lives have changed quite a bit over the past few weeks and adapting to these changes is always a formidable adventure. I’m hopeful everything will find its proper place and that we will find a balance and be successful with it all.
