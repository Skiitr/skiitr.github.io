Lately, it seems as if each week is bigger than the last. This week marked the end of my time with Avidyne, the end of first grade for my daughter, and the spring ballet performance which marks the conclusion of the ballet year. It has been a very busy and emotional week.

Avidyne will hold a dear place in my heart. It gave me the opportunity to work with more people than any job I’ve held in the past. About a year into my time at Avidyne, our department’s management was let go and we were left somewhat without direction. This sparked a time in my career where I had to drive myself to goals and help choose what our department could handle as far as outside requests for engineering bandwidth. The choice to take on extra jobs was something I never knew would help me grow as much as it has. This week I’ve heard all the stories of how I’ve affected everyone at Avidyne but I want everyone to know how much they have affected me and how much these extra roles have helped me grow as a person. I thank everyone I’ve worked with there and will miss each and every one of them.

In web development this week I’ve been all over the place but able to put in a good volume of time. Firstly, I took and moved my AviFish app off of Slylion.com and moved it to dangallagher.xyz. This way anyone still using this application at Avidyne will have access to it in the future. I was also able to listen to a few podcasts and I read a few articles on JavaScript and code refactoring. In addition, I took the first quarter of the new web design class on code school dealing with how to design a site based on a user-centered approach. And finally, I rounded off the week with some katas on Codewars to keep my skills sharp.

In my family time this week it was all about getting to my daughter end of her school year, which included the aforementioned Spring ballet performance. After many rehearsals, Saturday was the show. My daughter had a duet dance with one of the senior level dancers of the school and it was such a beautiful piece. She did great and I’m very proud of her. This week also marked the successful end of first grade for my daughter as well. She performed awesome throughout her studies.

I think the whole family breathed a collective sigh of relief by the end of the week. End of career at Avidyne, end of first grade, and another year of ballet ended successfully. Next week marks a few more big milestones for us and I think I’ll feel better after my first week at the new job. Here is to another successful week and to moving further into summer 2016.
