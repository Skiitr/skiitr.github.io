This week has been very eventful. I’m working on many new things in my life and the changes can sometimes be scary. My wife and I have been changing our house around to better suit our evolving needs as a family, as have I in many areas of my life as well. We have also been a single car family for the past 14 years and this is something we have been debating changing. All in all, this has been a week of careful consideration of changes in our lives.

Work this week was mainly about two big things - interns and engineering change orders. The Avidyne hardware engineering department had three new interns start this week. This made the first half of the week dedicated to the orientation of systems, processes, and procedures. I feel like I talked more in the first two days this week than I have in the whole previous week. The second part of the week was all about a few large changes that have taken weeks to put together and execute. Our biggest of these was finally released just prior to walking out the door on Friday afternoon.

I also was asked to give an extensive presentation on the technical breakdown of a product. This was given to the executive team and all of the management of the company. I felt this went very well and many folks came up after and thanked me for the thorough presentation.

I have had a crazy week and my web development studies have paid the price for this. I was able to start a course on egghead.io but this was mostly a review of information I’ve learned in previous Angular classes. I also took some time and read through my portfolio webpage and tweaked a few areas that either needed updating or clarification.

In personal goals, the 30 Days of Gravity program is concluded tonight. It is quite a big deal and I’m very excited we were able to complete it with only a minor pause along the way. I’m not sure what program will be next but I’m sure within the next 1-3 days we will start another fitness program to challenge ourselves for an additional 30 days.

As I mentioned in my previous journal entry, I have been getting back into PC gaming. I took some time with a turn-based and a real-time strategy game, a multiplayer online battle area, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game, as well as a third person shooter. After two years I’m a little lost as to where I want to put in time. So far I think I’ve enjoyed playing the turn-based X-COM and the MOBA Heroes of the Storm the most. I’m only able to put in a couple of hours a week to any of these so we will see as this progresses.

The week has been all about planning for the future and what lies ahead for myself and my family. Because of the hectic nature of the week, I feel pretty worn down and I am ready for a more stable week ahead. I’m not sure if that is going to happen but I’m trying to plan for things a bit ahead of time and hopefully, that will help.
