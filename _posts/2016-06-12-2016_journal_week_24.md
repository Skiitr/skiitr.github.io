I have found myself settling in and finding the balance in day-to-day activities this week. I’ve been able to accomplish a bit more this week by adding extra activities to my regular routine. Whether it is listening to something during my drive or working on some web development projects during lunch, every bit helps. I hope this is a good representation of what I can accomplish with my upcoming weeks.

I’ve now finished my second week at Orion Technologies and I’m getting into a groove there. I’ve started to get up and running on a few projects and once I can complete one or two of these I’ll start to feel a bit more sure on my feet. Overall it seems like every day it is a bit clearer on what is expected of me in this new position. Orion won a very nice award this week from the Orlando Business Journal. The award, Fast 50, looks at thousands of companies in Central Florida and out of them Orion was awarded second place. This was a great honor and everyone at Orion is very excited about the honor.

In my web development studies, I was able to find a solution to the keyboard entry feature for my Calculist2 application. I found a very nice JavaScript library called Mousetrap.js. Mousetrap captures key entries and maps them to functions. This way I was able to call the same click event in Angular that is entering numbers and functions into the calculator but from the keyboard. I’m very excited about this progress and now that I have it working I hope to push this up to the live version soon.

Next week is the Front End Design Conference in St. Petersburg, Florida. This will be my first web conference and I’m very excited to hear everyone speak. I hope that I come out of the conference with a renewed sense of creative energy. I’m sure next week, after the conference, I’ll have quite a bit to share.

My drive to work has allowed for me to get to my first audiobook of the new commute. The book, A Wanted Man by Lee Child, is another in the Jack Reacher series. The book has a run time of about 14 hours and, with the audio at 1.20x speed, I was able to finish the whole book in a week. I’m very much looking forward to the progress I can make on my book list over the next few months. I think I’m still going to try and fit a few podcasts in between the books, but even if I could do a book every other week I’ll be able to get through quite a bit of my backlog.

Overall another good week, we have added more people to our list of company in town and that certainly adds to the list of activities to accomplish each week. My goals for the upcoming week will be quite different than normal with the conference. But I hope to complete some tasks I’ve started at work and possibly finish my second audio book of my list. Here is to another week like the last.
