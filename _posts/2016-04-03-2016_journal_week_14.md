This week was both eventful and simple. My family and I had a handful of important events that happened this week but overall it felt very simple without a large amount of chaos intermixed.

At work this week I continued to improve the performance of the 3D printer I fixed and now have it working as it used to. This allowed me to print a few fixtures the company had been paying an outside vendor for previously. Unfortunately, during this process, I had the misfortune of slipping with an x-acto knife and opening up my finger quite badly. This required a trip to urgent care. After stressing about tetanus shots and stitches I didn’t have to have either. The cut definitely went to the bone but apparently it was a clean enough cut that it sealed up well and, at the end of the week, it only hurts a little.

In my web development studies this week it has been nose to the grindstone working on my Calculist2 application. Through the use of Angular in this project, I’ve really come to admire the framework. I was able to get the list side of the application working well and now you can enter in equations, have them solved, put them in a list, reorder the list, rename the cards, and delete cards from the list. The next order of business is to allow for keyboard entry and to work out all of the bugs in the code. After this is fully up and running, I am going to try and hook this up to Firebase to allow for user authentication and persistent state across devices. In other web development news, I have been reading the You Don’t Know JS series by Kyle Simpson, and hope to finish these books off over the coming weeks as well.

This upcoming week is my daughter's birthday and to celebrate with her I took her to the rock climbing gym we used to go to when she was younger. We had a very nice morning of climbing and it is very moving to reflect back on her growth over the past few years. It was also nice to get back to the gym and climb myself. I was able to climb two or three 5.8 (skill level) routes after a two-year lull in my climbing. Previously I was working on climbing 5.10 routes so it was nice to see I had not fallen too far off the mark over the years. We also had a joint birthday party for my daughter and step-father this weekend. This was a nice gathering of family and kicked off one of three birthday celebrations for our little one. And to wrap up the weekend we saw the Melbourne air show on Sunday afternoon. It was a very fun weekend.

So with lots of work going into the week - literal blood, sweat, and tears, quite a few events have transpired. Somehow it didn’t seem very chaotic and for that I’m grateful. I’m looking forward to the polishing/finishing process for my web app and for the upcoming birthday week for my daughter.
