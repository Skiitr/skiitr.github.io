Finding my way in some areas and losing my way in others, this week has been another of gains and losses. Yet for that, identifying the issues and starting to correct them is the first step in making progress and I feel I’ve done that to some degree. All in all a week of a bit more introspection.

I’ve finished the fourth week at the new job, and I now have been through a few others’ design reviews and one of my own. This has given me a better understanding of the expectations the company has for me in the position I was hired for. I’ve also put the wheels in motion to start helping with a standardization effort that is desired to bring everyone on the same page with the design tools that we use. I’m excited to kick this off and make more of a contribution to the company's future.

Speaking of finishing things, I finished the 28-hour long audiobook, Without Remorse by Tom Clancy. Was a very good book overall and I’m very glad I put in the time to get through it all. It’s amazing to hear some of the tiny details about the Vietnam War that I didn’t even consider previously.

I’m starting to have some doubts about my abilities to stay on task with my web development studies. My new job has really taken a toll on both my extra time and the amount of energy I have remaining at the end of the day after a 2.5-hour commute. Add to this any extra chores or errands I need to do in the evenings and I have been having difficulty finding the extra time to study. This leaves me personally in debt in two areas of my life - firstly, in my desire to continually develop and learn as both a technologist and a human; secondly, in my ability to reduce stress in my day-to-day with some form of workout. The weekend warrior is the first thought that comes to mind to correct this, but this is the only appreciable amount of time I have to spend with my family and I will sacrifice that. So here I find myself, organized in career, disorganized in life.

One of my interests over the past year has been in graphic design. I’ve always had a love for the nuance of things like logo development and brand identity. So, one of the ways I could continue my technical development is to switch focuses from web development to graphic design. Both play so well into each other I think it might be beneficial if I took a wander down that path to see if there is a spark there I can ignite.

About finding the time for workouts I’m thinking one of the ways I can head this off is to get up early enough to fit something in prior to my commute to work. This way I can jump start my day and metabolism at the same time. Also, I will not have to worry about how to fit this in after a tiring day at the office and on the road. We will see if I can get that going soon.

One of the very exciting things we were able to do this weekend, because of the new job, was to attend an Orlando City Pride game. Orion has season tickets to both Orlando City Lions and Pride games and allows employees to use these tickets. We went to the game tonight and it was incredible. Great seats, front row center! I’m very grateful to have the opportunity to use such a wonderful benefit from the company.

So while I’m getting settled at work, I’m now trying to find my way in my life. I imagine this is not a strange feeling to most but when only 4 weeks ago I felt I had both under great control, I’m feeling a bit untethered losing control over such large portions of my life. I’m sure with some hard work and appropriate adjustments I can get the ship righted and back on track, I guess time will tell.
