After the first third of the year and 17 weeks of journaling my accomplishments, I feel good about my progress. I would be remiss to say I've done as much as I'd have wished, but the pace has been steady and, for that, I'm grateful. All that being said I've not taken a week off yet this year, and I think I'm due for one soon.

At work this week, I was playing catch-up on a load of document changes that needed to be finished by the end of the month. I also created block diagrams of the technology I did the teardown on last week. After about 15 drawing updates and new documents creations, I'm ready to get back to design work next week.

This week, in my web development, I was able to finish up the first release of Calculist2. I had a few testers help me find the last few bugs and I worked with the styles to tweak them for release. To get this released, I had to configure my build setup in Gulp. I tried to use Webpack with Gulp, but in the end, I just ran a concat on all of my script files. I also had an issue with uglifying my script files so I served the non-minified version for release. I'm very proud to have completed my app to this point.

In personal goals, my wife and I turned back to our most successful fitness plan from the past Darebee’s 30 Days of Gravity. Doing daily workouts, every day, regardless of how tired you feel or how busy you are, has shown to have had the greatest results on our fitness. We are now more than 10 days in and feeling great because of it. Here is to the next 10 days and the 10 after that.

My wife and I also had the ingenious idea to repurpose a bookshelf into a platform couch. This took quite a bit of sanding to remove the old finish off our bookshelf that had been stored in the garage for the past year. Then we attached a new plywood top and stained it a nice weathered grey. And if that wasn’t enough, at the last minute I was able to construct a desk top out of one of the remaining pieces of plywood. I’ve been working without a proper desk for a year and a half now, and we have been trying to find a workable solution for everyone in the house. I’m testing this out tonight, so we will see. Overall it was quite a weekend's worth work to finish both projects and now we are just working on cushioning for the top of the couch and setting up my desk.

It was a week of finishing things off, changes at work and Calculist2 in my web development studies. With my family, it was the start of a few new things - new furniture, and a new workout program. Starting and finishing, opening new chapters and closing out others, it is a nice feeling either way and a good close to the week.
