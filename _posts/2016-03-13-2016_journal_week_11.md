Stress was the theme this week. With a number of family issues springing up, we have had quite a physically and emotionally challenging week. Add to this keeping up with personal goals and dealing with work issues it has been tough. I was still able to get more done than I had predicted by mid-week, but overall this week was just one of those weeks where you work with the hand you're dealt day-to-day and try and keep your composure.

In work news, I was able to wrap up two PCB designs this week. There wasn’t much in the way of design time on either of these boards, but the process overhead was the same for these test boards as our production boards so it took a little extra time to get them ready for release. I also completed more documentation updates. But overall, the biggest thing at work this week was the initial planning phase for a few new products. It’s always an exciting as well as confusing time for everyone.

In web development this week, I was able to make larger strides than I thought I would. I finished my third Angular course, this time on Treehouse. It is interesting to see how each teacher attacks the subject from different angles. I hope to take the Egghead.io course after this one as well as finally build out a project using Angular. I started learning Angular 2 and the research was quite dizzying at times. All the changes between versions left me with the feeling that I didn't know anything about Angular at all. Lastly, I listened to a handful of Toolsday podcasts, some more ShopTalk Show episodes, and have been reading up on all sorts of topics from accessibility with HTML tags to CSS linting. It was a full week of web development studies.

I was able to finish off my Trello Data Reporter app, at least to the minimum viable product stage, and publish it on GitHub Pages. This lead into one of my next projects - a possible split for this website. Currently, this site is based on both PCB design and Web Development. I’d like to create a space that is just devoted to web development.
In my personal life, as I mentioned before, the week has been a roller coaster of emotions. Kid meltdowns, parent meltdowns, and aging grandparents have all been the focus here and I think we all feel a bit drained from it all. We’ve had the bad and the good and all in between but everyone is good now and I hope for a less stressful week ahead.

More and more I’m looking forward to each week now because of how I’ve been breaking down my accomplishments into one-week chunks. Every Monday is a fresh start and a chance to do amazing things. It's a chance to ask myself “So, what am I learning this week?” This brings about a wonderful anticipatory feeling where I feel like I can tackle anything.
