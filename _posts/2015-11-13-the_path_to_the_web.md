Here I am nearing the end of 2015...I started off on a journey in early 2014 to learn a few new skills that would help me with leveling-up my day-to-day technical skills. This included me digging back into a few Udacity courses on programming I had taken in the Summer of 2013, as well as picking up some new skills on CodeAcademy. All in all, this lasted about 3-4 months until life again became quite busy for me as my wife was pregnant and about to give birth to our second child. If a second child wasn't enough, the company I work for had decided to lay off almost half the staff and my role there changed dramatically. I was busy, the extra time for learning came second.

Fast forward to 2015. This year my son turned two, my daughter six, and my wife and I juuust about have the hang of how to parent two children (most days). This control allowed me to gravitate back to my passion for self-education.

In early 2015 I headed back to my old friend Udacity. Here I was looking for what I was going to dive into when I noticed this new idea they had for programs called Nanodegrees. This sounded perfect for me all except the monetary commitment to something that I wasn't sure I could commit to for the length of time required. After much consideration, I decided that I was interested in learning the information regardless of whether or not a certificate came at the end. I started by taking three courses from Udacity focusing on something new to me called Front-End Development.

Front End Development wasn't something I was aware of at the time so I started researching to see what this new "thing" was that looked so interesting. The further and further I dove into this world of web design and development, the more amazed I was amazed at how interesting it seemed. Little did I know this would soon envelope the next 6-8 months of my life.

Once I was hooked and had a name for what it was I was looking to study, I went at it full force. The first few months I was putting in an excess of 60 hours of study time and was just teeming with new skills that I had only just scratched the surface of. The pace I was learning at couldn't hold and soon this became more of a 30-40 hours per month and finally settled nicely at about 20-30 hours per month of study time. This industry that I was learning so much about seemed to be an infinite ocean of information and I couldn't have been happier to be swimming in its beautiful waters.

My wife decided with summer break at hand she would take some of her free time and pursue her passion for writing by starting a blog. This gave me the opportunity to try out my newfound skills to craft a Wordpress site for her and I couldn't be prouder to be associated with giving her a platform in which she can host her beautiful writing.

I'm very lucky to be learning at a time when so much information is present from the web design and development industry. I have been taking classes from Udacity, CodeAcademy, Treehouse and Code School; reading articles on sites like CSS-Tricks, Smashing Magazine and A List Apart; subscribing to newsletters like Responsive Design Weekly, CSS Layout News and JavaScript Weekly; listening to podcasts like the former Treehouse Show and ShopTalk Show; and watching and an endless number of conference videos on anything from UX design to Sass to Optimizing your workflows.

I've now created a few websites and a simple application or two, and can't wait to see where these new skills and continued education take me in the coming year.
