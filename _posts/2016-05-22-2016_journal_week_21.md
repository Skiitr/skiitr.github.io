I have made two big changes in my life this past week and the following weeks will be a continuation of these two decisions. First and foremost is the changing of jobs. I’ve been offered a new position with a technology company in Orlando that I’ve accepted. The second, which stemmed from the first, is that after 14 years, we have added a second car to our family. These two big life changes have dominated our week.

At Avidyne this week, I put in my resignation after 3.5 years with the company. Overall everything that happened during the process of putting in my two weeks notice was as good as I could have hoped for. Many well wishes lined with the sadness of losing a colleague were expressed. I have been very touched by how many people have been excited for my new opportunity and the abundance of kind words towards our time working together. It was a very nostalgic week, and I think my last week at Avidyne will be even more so.

Again my web development studies haven't been up to par and I aim to change this in the upcoming week. I was, however, able to start working with React and doing research on the JavaScript library everyone is talking about. React is the product of Facebook and is being used in many new applications and websites. Seems like the community is still finding a solid place for React but also that it is here to stay, at least for now. I’ll be continuing my exploration in the coming week.

My personal time this week has been all about our finding our second car. As with anything, it is all about gathering the proper research and making the most informed decision. This is a good start but if felt as if once we made it to the car dealerships most of that goes out the window. My wife and I could only be described as introverts and about the worst thing you could have us do it go negotiate with used car dealers all day long. That being said we did end up with a nice car, that we are in love with, and we feel like we got a good deal on it. I think I had the hardest night sleep of the whole week after yesterday's marathon of car wheeling and dealing. I’m happy to have that over with.

With both new changes, the upcoming week will be all about how these will affect the months ahead. I have one more week at Avidyne and then I move on, and now with two cars, our years of juggling cars are in the past. I’m excited to see how the week will play out at Avidyne and how it will be having a second car to help manage everything we have going on each week.
