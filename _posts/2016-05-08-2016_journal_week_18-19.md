Today is Mother’s day, a very special day when we recognize the gifts our mothers have given us throughout our lives. To my mom who did such a wonderful job raising me, and providing me with every opportunity, even when things were very tough in her life - I love you, Mom; to my mother-in-law, who did such an amazing job raising two super strong and kind girls: to my grandmothers on all sides of my parents, both those still with us and those still alive in our hearts; and lastly, and mostly, to my wonderful wife who wears the badge of Mother by being the greatest role model of kindness and strength to our two little ones, I love you the most. Happy Mother's Day to you all.

I took a week off last week, so this write-up will cover two journal entries. Good things have happened in my life and I’m feeling good about my personal as well as professional progress. I did, however, get sick last weekend and it took all week to shake the cold completely, so that wasn't fun.

At work over the last two weeks it has been more implementation of change requests. I processed three major engineering change orders (ones that take more the 16 hours of work to submit) and about 8 minor ECOs (taking less than 4 hours total to complete). It has been a good wrap-up on many issues that have been found over the last few months. In the next week, I hope to get back into a board re-design where we are adding new backlight circuits, and additional protection to our dimming bus circuitry. This has been of a lower priority but I have cleared the way for this work now.

As I stated before, I took a week off and this was mostly a week off from studying web development. I’ve come back to it this week at a slower pace. This week I focused on working with my programming skills and keeping my JavaScript chops fresh by doing some Katas on Codewars. I still find this site very useful for keeping up with coding skills.

In personal goals, my wife and I are still doing 30 Days of Gravity. We took a two day pause while I was sick but as soon as I had the strength to do the day I was back and going again. We are now past day 23 and well on our way to finishing off this series.

I had a big project that I have been working over the last two weeks. It was two fold. Firstly, I continued developing the desk setup I created two weeks ago. Hanging a shelf up and adding an under shelf to the desk was just the beginning of setting up this new area for myself in our house. The second phase was much larger. I used to be an avid PC gamer and about two years ago I walked away from Windows which limited my options to game. This weekend marked the return of my old PC and bringing it back up to date with Windows 10. This now allows me to play games I’ve missed over the past two year and I’m excited to be adding gaming into my hobby rotation. So adding this desktop computer to my desk setup has been the icing on the cake. I can’t stop smiling every time I see my new area with everything set up so nicely.

It was great to take the week off from my web development studies. Also now that I have my PC backup and running, I find myself developing on my MacBook Pro, gaming on my Windows 10 PC, and mobile with my Android phone and tablet. I like the idea of using each system to suit my individual needs. As I always say, I’ll see how this goes for now and things can always change in the future to meet ever changing circumstances.
